              ![screenshot](./images/screenshot.png)

- We implemented #my_each, #my_each_with_index, #my_select, #my_all?, #my_any?, #my_none?, #my_count, #my_map, #my_inject
These methods are coded without using any Enumerable library method.

## Rspec Testing

- Spec tests using Rspec have been added in spc folder for all the enumerable methods
- Each method has a separate describe block and each testing aspect is covered with it block
- Used describe block, it block, expect and eql methods.
- Variables for testing purpose are created with let
- You can run the tests by simply running rspec or rspec --format documentation for more formated results on command line
